Some of the programming patterns I used were the singleton pattern. My card.lua file has the card’s instances which makes sure I didn’t have duplicates and had consistent card data. I also used state patterns to keep track of mana and when player pressed the submit button. I think what I did well was organizing my code into separate files to keep track of everything and make sure my card data was consistent. What I would do differently is maybe make more files to separate parts of the game such as a play file to make it run smooth.
